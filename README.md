## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Im a full stack dev with most of my experience in C# but enjoy picking up whatever is needed to get the job done.
I have a particular interest in clean design and architecture and how to keep an application high quality over a long lifetime while being maintained by more than 1 person.
Gamer outside of works an im usually up for anything team based regardless of thats involved.


### Current projects
Im slowly working through project ideas
- The first being AutoFront (Thank ChatGPT for the name). The project is a dynamic fontend that can be used to present business data and trigger business functions. The aim is to allow developers who dont want to touch frontend tech to still be able to put together something quick for things like back office applications.
    - Written in SolidJS with javascript
    - Contains an open api spec that a dev can bui;d a backend server for the frontend to automatically discover what pages to display and what business object and actions are available.
